unfold

Display enclosing brace context of grep search results for c-like languages
e.g. to display enclosing classes, traits.. for search results
eases searching through deeply nested source from the commandline

requires filenames and line numbers emitted by grep; works from stdin->stdout

example useage:
grep -rn "fn\s*foo" . --include "*.rs" |unfold

output of grep:-
another.rs:130:        fn foo();
another.rs:130:        fn foo();

output of unfold:-
another.rs:38-     mod fruit {
another.rs:68-         trait Citrus {
another.rs:130:            fn foo();
